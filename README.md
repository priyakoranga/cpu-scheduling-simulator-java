# CPU Scheduler


A CPU Scheduling Simulator built in Java that visually and programmatically demonstrates the working of various CPU scheduling algorithms. This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering curriculum in the 3rd year of BTech in Computer Science.

üìå Features
Simulates multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:

First-Come First-Serve (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling

Calculates:

Turnaround Time

Waiting Time

Average Waiting Time

Average Turnaround Time

User-defined input: arrival time, burst time, quantum (for RR), and priority (for priority scheduling)

Clear textual output with tabular representation of results

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8+)

Command Line Interface (CLI)
